<h2>THE MAGIC CASTANETS</h2>


<p>Pilar was dancing in the Murillo (mu&#772;&#781;-r&#301;l´&#333;)
Garden. It was a beautiful public
garden named after the great Spanish
painter, Murillo, who died in a house near by.</p>

<p>Pilar had been born ten years ago in this
old city of Seville (se&#772;&#781;-v&#301;l´). If you had
asked Pilar, "Where is New York?" she
would doubtless have laughed with her
lovely dark eyes and inquired, "Is it in Seville?"
Because, to Pilar, as to most of her
friends, there was only one world, and that
world was Seville.</p>

<p>Now a terrible thing was happening at
Pilar's home this evening. But Pilar did not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
know it because she was dancing in the garden.
Every night, after her grandfather
went to bed, she ran off and danced with her
friends to the music of a hurdy-gurdy.</p>

<p>But tonight, after Pilar had left, her
grandfather had been taken very ill. The
neighbors had sent for a doctor, who shook
his head gravely over the poor old man.</p>

<p>Pilar knew nothing about this as she
clicked her castanets and whirled about in
the dance they call the Sevillana.</p>

<p>She was one of the best dancers in her
group. And why not? Her mother had
been a dancer; her grandmother, too, yes,
and her great-grandmother and her great-great&mdash;oh,
ever so many great-grandmothers!
They had all been dancers.</p>

<p>Pilar's parents had died when she was a
baby. She lived alone with her grandfather,
and they struggled to keep the wolf named
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
Hunger from their door. Her grandfather
was a shoemaker, but he worked slowly
these days because his hands were old.</p>

<p>Once when Pilar was very little, someone
had asked her what pleasures she enjoyed
most. She had answered, "The pleasures I
enjoy most are&mdash;dancing!"</p>

<p>Now this could easily be the answer of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
every little girl in southern Spain. For
while Italy sings, France designs, and
Switzerland skates, Spain dances. Why, it
is even possible that little girls in Seville
would rather dance than go to moving picture
shows!</p>

<p>Yet everyone in Seville does not feel that
way, for the many open air theaters all over
the city are crowded. And what the people
seem to like best are the American comedies.</p>

<p>It was growing late, but Pilar seldom went
to bed before midnight. She would have
told you that evening was the time to live
and to laugh and to dance. Then it was cool,
while during the day the sun beat down
cruelly and people slept for hours.</p>

<p>Through the narrow streets Pilar made
her way home at last. She heard little
snatches of song from the throats of strollers.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>

<p>Everyone strolls in Seville; there is no
hurry. Nearly everyone sings; there is no
worry. Hurry and worry are as much out of
place in this city as a woman's hat shop.
For white flowers and black lace shawls take
the place of hats in Seville.</p>

<p>Pilar hummed to herself as she walked
along. Some day she would grow up to be a
great dancer like her mother and&mdash;</p>

<p>What was that? A light in her house?
She looked through the window and saw the
doctor bending over her grandfather's bed.</p>

<p>Pilar caught her breath. Then she rushed
indoors and ran straight to her grandfather's
bedside. Sinking down on her
knees, she burst into tears.</p>

<p>"Oh, Grandfather!" she cried. "You are
ill! Dear Grandfather, what is the matter?"</p>

<p>The doctor smoothed her soft, black hair
and raised her to her feet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>


 <div align="left">
   <span style="font-size:.7em">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEN PILAR WAS LITTLE<br />
   <img style="float:left;" src="./images/illus014.jpg" width="300"
   height="395" border="0" alt="WHEN PILAR WAS LITTLE"></img></span>
  </div>

<p>"There, now, my
child," he said. "You
must not cry. You will
only make your grandfather
worse. He will
get well if you will do
what I tell you."</p>


<p>"What&mdash;what is that,
doctor?" Poor Pilar
was trembling.</p>

<p>"You must buy and
cook good, nourishing food for him," said
the doctor. "And give him the medicines
which I order."</p>

<p>Now Pilar's eyes were full of terror.
"But, oh, doctor," she cried. "I cannot do
that. We have no money."</p>

<p>"No money?" The doctor looked at her
pityingly.</p>

<p>"We live by what Grandfather makes
when he can work," said Pilar. "Now that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
he cannot work, there will be no money."</p>

<p>The doctor said, "Um-m" and stroked his
beard. Then he asked, "Have you nothing
which you might sell?"</p>

<p>"Only&mdash;" And Pilar gazed into her tiny
cubbyhole of a room next door. "Only an
old wooden chest filled with souvenirs, left
to me by my mother." She added in a
whisper, "I could not sell them!"</p>

<p>The doctor was silent for a moment. Then
he said, "I am afraid you must sell them,
Pilar, if you wish your grandfather to live."</p>

<p>When the doctor was gone, Pilar went into
her room and looked at the precious wooden
chest. In it were the souvenirs which her
mother had collected throughout her interesting
life as a dancer.</p>

<p>The doctor had given her grandfather
medicine, and now he slept. But what would
happen in the morning?</p>

<p>Pilar shuddered. She was only a little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
girl, and she was afraid. The doctor had
said that her grandfather must have the best
of everything, or maybe he would die.</p>

<p>A tear splashed down upon the old, carved
chest. There was only one thing to do. Tomorrow
she would go into town and sell one
of her mother's souvenirs so that she might
buy medicine and food.</p>

<p>She brushed away the tears and began to
look through her treasures. There were a
tall, graceful comb; a faded, but elegant
fan; a richly decorated old bonnet; oh, such
lovely things! How could she ever part with
them?</p>

<p>She pulled out a pair of castanets (k&#259;s´-t&#551;-n&#277;ts´).
Now, in Spain, it seems that every
baby is born with a pair of castanets in its
hand. Of course, I only said, "It seems."
Yet some of the tiniest tots are taught to
click these wooden clappers to the rhythm of
the traditional Spanish songs and dances.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>Castanets are shaped very much like
chestnuts. They say that this is why they
are called castanuellos, which means "chestnuts"
in Spanish.</p>

<p>But those which had belonged to Pilar's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
mother were no ordinary castanets. Indeed,
they were said to possess some wonderful
and dangerous power.</p>

<p>Mysterious legends had passed from
mother to daughter down through Pilar's
family. Each legend told of trouble caused
by the loss of these castanets. For whenever
they had been lost, given, stolen, or
sold, misfortune had come to their owners.</p>

<p>A bit of verse, composed, no doubt, by the
first ancestor who had used them, warned
thus:</p>

      <div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
      <span class="i0">"<i>Castanets, with magic spell,</i><br /></span>
      <span class="i0"><i>Never lose or give or sell;</i><br /></span>
      <span class="i0"><i>If you do, then grief and strife</i><br /></span>
      <span class="i0"><i>Will follow you through all your life</i>."<br /></span>
      </div></div>

<p>But Pilar had never heard the old rime.
Nor had her grandfather ever told her the
strange legends. He did not want to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
frighten her. Besides, he realized that modern,
educated people would have called such
beliefs very foolish.</p>

<p>So Pilar did not know about the power of
the magic castanets, and she fell asleep that
night with these words going through her
head: "Which souvenir shall I sell tomorrow?
Which one shall it be?"</p>

<h2>AN OLD RED CAPE</h2>


<p>Morning came. Pilar attended her sick
grandfather and made him comfortable in
his bed. He did not speak to her. He
seemed to want to doze all the time.</p>

<p>She went into her room and knelt down
beside the wooden chest. She must go now
and sell one of the treasures. Which one
should it be?</p>

<p>She took out each in turn and looked at
them. All were so precious&mdash;parts of her
mother's life. Here was an old pair of castanets,
scarred and battered, not so pretty
as the beautiful comb, the handsome clock,
the embroidered bonnet, or&mdash;</p>

<p>Perhaps she would sell those ugly castanets.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
And yet&mdash;just look at this old red
cape! Like a bullfighter's cape, only small
and faded and torn&mdash;surely the least interesting
and attractive of her treasures. She
took it into her grandfather's room.</p>

<p>"Grandfather," she said, "I am going to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
the shop of Juan (hwän) Sanchez, and I
shall ask him to buy this old cape. With the
money I shall buy food."</p>

<p>Her grandfather opened his dull eyes and
looked first at the black-eyed, rosy little
Pilar and then at the old red cape.</p>

<p>"It belonged, once long ago, to&mdash;Tony&mdash;"
he began.</p>

<p>Then his voice trailed off. He closed his
eyes and fell asleep again. He was very
feeble.</p>

<p>Pilar kissed him gently and stole out of the
house.</p>

<p>The narrow streets of Seville looked like
thin Arabs with their arms pressed close to
their white-robed sides. They were bright
with sunlight. They were noisy with
squawking motor horns, with chattering
men and women.</p>

<p>Juan's shop was on the Street of the Serpents,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
a wriggling ribbon of a street with
booths and shops and cafés&mdash;a street of ragged
people, of staring people, of chanting,
selling people. But no automobiles or wagons
were allowed upon the Street of the
Serpents.</p>

<p>Pilar met Juan Sanchez at the door of his
tiny shop.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Se&ntilde;orita (s&#257;´ny&#333;-r&#275;´-tä)
Pilar," he smiled.</p>

<p>He was glad to see Pilar. Everyone in
Spain is always glad to see children. This
is a good thing, because Spain is overflowing
with children.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Se&ntilde;or (s&#257;-ny&#333;r´) Juan,"
said the little girl. Then, timidly she held
up the faded old cape. "Will you buy this
from me?" she asked. "My grandfather is
ill, and I must have money to pay for food
and medicine."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>Juan looked at the cape. He said nothing,
but his mouth twitched as though it wanted
to smile. He turned the cape inside out and
stared at something he saw.</p>

<p>"The name 'Tony' is printed in ink on the
inside of this cape," he said.</p>

<p>But Pilar was not interested. She only
looked up at him and repeated earnestly,
"Will you buy it, se&ntilde;or? Will you?"</p>

<p>Juan shook his head. "No, Pilar," he answered.
"I cannot buy it because it is worth
nothing to me."</p>

<p>Then as he saw the cloud cover her smile,
he added, "But it may be worth a great deal
to you if you will send it away!"</p>

<p>"If I will send it away, se&ntilde;or?" Pilar
thought that the good Juan must be teasing
her. "What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean," he said, "that you must send it
to America to the one whose name is written
here."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>He pointed to the name Tony. It meant
nothing until Juan explained.</p>

<p>"Years ago," he said, "Tony was a little
boy who played in the streets of Seville. He
liked to play bullfight. This is the cape with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
which he angered the make-believe bull. I
was that bull."</p>

<p>"You, Juan? You were the bull?" laughed
Pilar.</p>

<p>"Yes, and a fierce one with great horns
which I held proudly to my head," answered
Juan. "But today," he went on, "today this
Tony&mdash;ah, he is a very rich man. He has
made many American dollars."</p>

<p>"But how did his cape come to be among
my mother's souvenirs?" asked Pilar.</p>

<p>"When Tony went away to seek his fortune
in America," said Juan, "he must have
given it to your mother. They lived next
door to each other when they were children.
They were very good friends."</p>

<p>"But why should I send the cape to Tony
in America?" asked Pilar.</p>

<p>"Because," answered Juan, "I am sure
that he will remember your mother and help
you in your trouble."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>Pilar's eyes shone. "Oh, do you think so?"
she cried.</p>

  </table>

<p>Juan nodded his head knowingly. "I shall
send it for you, Pilar," he said. "And I shall
write a letter, too, and tell Tony about your
sick grandfather. Now take this money,
child, and buy what you need."</p>

<p>He pressed some coins into Pilar's hand,
but she shrank back.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, no, no!" she exclaimed. "I cannot
take money from you, se&ntilde;or, when I have
given you nothing for it!"</p>

<p>Juan laughed. "Very well, little proud
one," he said. "You may bring me something
else tomorrow."</p>

<p>Pilar thought of the old pair of castanets.</p>

<p>She asked Juan whether he would take
them, and he replied, "Of course. It is not
difficult to sell castanets in Seville."</p>

<p>So Pilar left the shop of Juan Sanchez,
and her heart sang as she skipped along.
She bought bread and fish and eggs and she
took them home.</p>

<p>She cooked the fish and the eggs in oil, as
Spanish people do. Then she poured some
milk out of a pitcher and tried to make her
grandfather eat and drink.</p>

<p>After that, she went into her tiny room
and once again opened the wooden chest.
This time she took out the magic castanets,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
whose mysterious history she did not know.</p>

  <table border="0" cellpadding="0" width="550">

<p>But her grandfather knew all those terrible
legends which had been handed down
through the family. He was too intelligent
really to believe them but when Pilar came
into his room holding the clappers in her
hand, his eyes suddenly filled with fear.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>"What are you doing with the castanets,
Pilly?" he asked in his weak voice.</p>

<p>"I am going to sell them to Juan Sanchez,"
answered Pilar, smoothing his pillow.
"Then I shall buy a little chicken and cook it
for your dinner."</p>

<p>"No, no!" The old man tried to sit up in
bed. "Do not sell the cast&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Pilar interrupted him. "Please,
Grandfather," she said. "You must not
talk. You must rest while I am gone."</p>

<p>She made him lie down again and he sank
back wearily, closing his eyes. He was too
weak to say any more, but his lips began to
move.</p>

<p>"Castanets, with&mdash;magic&mdash;spell&mdash;" he
muttered to himself.</p>

<p>The words were muffled. Pilar could not
understand them.</p>

<p>She patted his hand gently and said, "Go
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
to sleep, dear Grandfather. Do not worry.
Pilar will take good care of you."</p>

<p>Then she sang a little song which sounded
like a Moorish chant. And perhaps it was,
for Spain once was ruled by the Moors, who
left much of their art and music behind them
when they were driven out.</p>

<p>Pilar's soothing voice soon lulled her
grandfather to sleep. And so it was that
he did not finish the verse about the castanets.</p>

<p>It was a pity, too, as you will agree when
you have heard the legend of the castanets
in old Cadiz (k&#259;d´&#301;z).</p>

<p>Before the Moors came into Spain, Cadiz,
or Gadir, as it was then called, had become
famous for its dancers. Throughout the
land they were known for their grace and
beauty.</p>

<p>Now there lived at this time one who had
grown too old to dance any more. So she
wished to teach her little daughter the steps
she had once loved so well.</p>

<p>But strangely enough, she was afraid to
do this&mdash;afraid, because a savage race called
the Visigoths (v&#301;z´&#301; g&#335;ths) were sweeping
through Spain and were trying to destroy
the art of the people. They were overrunning
the country, smashing great statues

<p>Although she feared the Visigoths, this
mother, who had once been a dancer, used to
take her daughter to a cave far from the
city. And here she would attempt to instruct
the little girl.</p>

<p>But young Lira did not want to learn to
dance. She was plump and lazy. She disliked
to exercise, except with a knife and
fork. For eating was the only thing she
really enjoyed.</p>

<p>One day when the sun shone fiercely, Lira
felt very sorry for herself. She was hot and
twice as lazy as usual&mdash;which, I assure you,
was dreadfully lazy!</p>

<p>She decided that she would not take her
dancing lesson. Yet how was she to escape
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
it? Soon her mother would be leading her
off to the cave and making her work.</p>

<p>Lira bit into a large loaf of bread and
thought furiously. Why, of course! She
would hide her mother's castanets and then
say that she had lost them. This was a
splendid idea.</p>

<p>So running off ahead of her mother, she
made her way to the secret cave. Below her
lay the city of Cadiz. It was so white that it
made one think of chalk on snow. But to
hungry little Lira, it looked like whipped
cream!</p>

<p>Cadiz points her long, white finger out into
the azure blue bay. She has a gleaming
golden eye, which is the dome of her cathedral.</p>

<p>When Lira's mother arrived at the cave,
Lira ran up to her and exclaimed, "Oh,
Mother, I have lost the castanets! And now
there will be no lesson today."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>She then sat down and continued to chew
contentedly upon her enormous loaf of
bread. But her mother's face turned white.</p>

<p>"What are you saying, child?" she cried.
"Do you tell me you have lost the castanets?"</p>

<p>Lira nodded and took an unusually large
bite out of the loaf. Her mother stood over
her, her face a mask of fear.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>"Lira," she gasped, "do you know what
you have done? If, indeed, you have lost
the castanets, then truly you have brought
misfortune upon your whole family."</p>

<p>Whereupon, her mother recited this
verse:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Castanets, with magic spell,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Never lose or give or sell;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>If you do, then grief and strife</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Will follow you through all your life</i>."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Lira's eyes grew big. The loaf of bread
dropped to the ground as she arose.</p>

<p>Leading her mother to the rock behind
which she had hidden the castanets, she
said, "Look, Mother. The castanets are not
really lost. I was only fooling you. They
are hidden in here and&mdash;"</p>

<p>She pulled out the loose rock and looked
behind it. The castanets were gone.</p>

<p>Now, in those days, people believed in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
spells and charms, and Lira's mother was
terribly frightened. She was also terribly
angry with Lira.</p>

<p>She hurried away toward home, leaving
Lira standing alone, with the tears running
down her plump little cheeks. She was
afraid to go home, and so she wandered
down to the wide beach.</p>

<p>Here children were playing, while boys
and girls with flashing eyes were swinging
along, clapping their hands and singing.
Music sounded. Laughter rang. Night had
begun to fall.</p>

<p>A crescent moon hung in the sky. It was
a moon that had been cut in half, and the
other half was Cadiz. The air was full of
dream dust, with garlic in it.</p>

<p>Lira did not feel the spell of night that had
settled upon the rest of the world. She was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
too miserable. What had become of the
castanets?</p>

<p>Had some evil power removed them from
behind that rock? And if so, what frightful
thing would happen to her and to her
family?</p>

<p>Gradually the people began to leave the
beach and finally Lira found herself alone.
She looked out across the bay&mdash;a bay that
was to become the scene of historic battles
during Spain's wars with England and
France.</p>

<p>Moonlight twinkled silvery upon the
water. It was very quiet. And then, all at
once, Lira heard a step behind her, and a
mysterious voice whispered: "Lira, Lira,
turn around!"</p>

<p>Her heart skipped like a pebble across a
lake. She turned. There stood her older
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
brother, his figure looming straight and tall
in the moonlight. Lira sighed with relief.</p>

<p>But her brother did not move. He only
stood, scowling down at her. Then he continued
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
to talk in that low, frightening voice.</p>

<p>"Do you know," he said, "that you have
brought terrible misfortune upon us, Lira?"</p>

<p>Lira felt the hot tears begin to sting her
eyes again. So he, too, was going to scold
her for losing the castanets! But suddenly
he took a step toward her and, thrusting his
face close to hers, said, "The Visigoths are
coming to drive us away from our homes!"</p>

<p>Lira began to tremble. Those terrifying
savages! She knew that they had been
sweeping her country, destroying everything
in their path. Now they were about to
descend upon her home. And it was all her
fault&mdash;hers! She sobbed and clung to her
brother.</p>

<p>"Oh, why did I do it?" she cried. "Why
did I hide the castanets?"</p>

<p>Her brother put his hand under her chin
and lifted her head so that their eyes met.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you sorry, little sister?" he asked
kindly.</p>

<p>Lira's answer was a pitiful wail.</p>

<p>"Will you ever tell another untruth?"</p>

<p>"No, no, never, as long as I live!"</p>

<p>"Will you remember the jingle about the
castanets?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes! Always and forever!"</p>

<p>"And will you work hard and learn to
dance and carry on our mother's art?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes! Oh, I will try so hard!"</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;look, sister!"</p>

<p>And to her amazement, Lira's brother held
out the magic castanets. He had been
watching when she hid them. And when she
had gone into the cave, he had played a trick
upon her by taking them away.</p>

<p>It was a trick that Lira never forgot&mdash;never,
though she lived to be very old. All
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
her life she treasured the magic castanets
and never again did she lose sight of them.</p>

<p>But something else she did lose, and that
was her round little figure. Indeed, she became
lovely and slender. She also became
a famous dancer, and one day she taught her
own children the dances of Spain.</p>

<h2>THE SOUVENIRS SPEAK</h2>


<p>Pilar was on her way to Juan's shop on
the Street of the Serpents. In her hand
were those magic castanets. She was taking
them to Juan. She was going to sell
them.</p>

<p>She passed the lovely Alcazar (äl-kä´thär)
Gardens, from which came the perfume of
flowers and blossoms. She heard the soft
voice of bells from the Giralda, a prayer
tower which had belonged to an ancient
Moorish mosque (m&#335;sk).</p>

<p>In a little square, some of Pilar's friends
were dancing to the music of a hurdy-gurdy.
Pilar stopped. How she longed to join them
in their dance!</p>

<p>The thought came to her that she had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
never tried her mother's castanets. She
wondered how they would sound. She fixed
them on her fingers and began to play.</p>

<p>Their beauty astonished her. They spoke.
They sang. They cried out to her feet and
she danced. She danced until she was
breathless and the hurdy-gurdy had gone
away. So had the children&mdash;gone to their
homes.</p>

<p>Pilar was alone. She stood in the center
of the little court, its white, balconied houses
all around, and its ancient fountain squatting
in the center.</p>

<p>But to Pilar, time had not passed. She
had been in a dream of music. The castanets
had drawn her into a dream of music
and dance.</p>

<p>Now she slowly unloosed them from her
fingers. Never had she known that such
beautiful sound could come from two wooden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
clappers. Why, her own little cheap ones
were hideous and shrill beside these speaking
marvels.</p>

    </tr>
  </table>

<p>How could she give them up? How could
she take them to Juan to be sold? No, no!
She must keep them. She must keep them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
and dance every day to their rippling music.</p>

<p>But Juan had given her money, for which
she had promised to bring him the castanets.
And it would never do to give Juan her own
instead, for that would be cheating.</p>

<p>But there were other lovely souvenirs in
her chest at home. Perhaps Juan would as
soon have one of these!</p>

<p>Pilar went home, and once again she knelt
down beside the wooden chest. Out came
each precious souvenir. Which should she
take to Juan in place of the castanets?</p>

<p>If those souvenirs could have spoken,
what strangely wonderful stories they could
have told!</p>

<p>Pretend, for fun, that they can speak, and
let us listen to their ancient voices.</p>

was hidden in a cave. Many years later, it
was found by shepherds who heard weird

<p>Next day Pilar brought Juan these souvenirs.
But it was of no use. Juan would
not have any of them. He shook his head
and told Pilar that he could not rob her of
her wonderful treasures.</p>

<p>"You must bring me the old castanets,
child," he said. "They are all that I will
take."</p>

very stubborn.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, child," he repeated, "These are too
fine and valuable to sell. Bring me the battered
old castanets, for they have little
value."</p>

<p>Poor Pilar! She now sat weeping in her
room&mdash;weeping silently so as not to disturb
her sick grandfather, who slept a great part
of the day.</p>

<p>She held the castanets in her hands and
looked at them tenderly. Juan had said that
they possessed little value. Oh, but they did
possess value to Pilar, for she loved them.</p>

<p>As to their real value, neither Pilar nor
Juan could possibly guess. For though the
other souvenirs might bring more in money,
the castanets might well bring joy or grief to
their owner. Or, at least, so it had seemed
to Pilar's ancestors.</p>

<p>However, Pilar had given her word to
Juan that she would bring them to his shop

tomorrow, and so she must. If only Juan

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>She loved its sheltered courts, its walls of
brightly colored tiles, its patios of cypress
trees and tinkling fountains. She loved the
stately arches, the graceful columns, and she
also loved a handsome young Moor named
Hamet. He was a soldier in Boabdil's army.</p>

<p>But while Catalina lived in a dream of
happiness, all was not so perfect with the
Moorish ruler, Boabdil. The Christian monarchs,
Ferdinand and Isabella, had reconquered
the kingdom of Granada.</p>

<p>One night after Catalina had danced in
one of the great halls, she met Hamet in the
Court of the Myrtles. The moon shone down
upon a crystal clear pool, and birds flew
about the court like fluttering ghosts.</p>

<p>The two young people lowered their voices
as they spoke. Hamet told Catalina of desperate
battles in which the Moors were being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
overthrown by the Christians. He seemed
much disturbed.</p>

<p>Finally he said, "Let us go where none can
hear us. I have something strange and terrible
to tell you."</p>

<p>He led her out upon a balcony where they
stood looking down upon the city of Granada.
Its little white, square fairy cubicles seemed
to be lit up with stars that fell down from the
sky.</p>

<p>"It has been said," began Hamet in a low
tone, "that the court astrologer predicted
the downfall of the kingdom under the reign
of Boabdil!"</p>

<p>Catalina shrank back. What if her Hamet
were to be taken away from her? This was
all she could think of, and the thought tortured
her. She did not consider the fate of
her people. She considered only herself and
what she would do, were Hamet to leave her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>A short time later, Granada did indeed
fall before the Christian rulers. And upon
that fateful day when the palace was seized,
Hamet was obliged to ride away from Granada
with Boabdil, his leader.</p>

<p>Outside of the city, the vanquished Boabdil
handed the keys of Granada to King Ferdinand.
Then he and his followers rode off
into the hills. The story goes that as they
reached a certain hill, Boabdil stopped to
gaze down upon his beloved "Red Castle,"
which he would never see again. And the
Moor wept.</p>

<p>His mother chided him, saying, "You do
well to weep like a woman for what you
failed to defend like a man."</p>

<p>The hill upon which this happened is still
known as "The Last Sigh of the Moor."</p>

<p>But to go back to Catalina at the palace.
Left alone without Hamet, she did not sigh,
nor did she weep. Oh, but she did storm
and rage and stamp her feet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>Catalina's temper was well known in the
palace. When a servant came to summon
her to dance before the new rulers, his knees
shook with fright.</p>

<p>"Fair d-dancer," he began, "w-will you
c-come&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"I will not!" screamed Catalina, and threw
her shoe at him.</p>

<p>Then the miserable girl sank down upon
her couch and fell into a fit of weeping.</p>

<p>At twilight, Catalina stood upon that same
balcony where Hamet had told her what the
court astrologer had predicted. All had
come true, and the conquest of Granada
marked the end of Moorish power in Spain.</p>

<p>To Catalina came the voice of the town below.
The Sierra Nevada Mountains raised
their snowy tips, and the smell of little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
donkeys mingled with mountain perfumes.</p>

<p>One star shone, Moor-like, in the deep blue
heaven. There was a fringe of orange light
where the sun had just gone to bed, leaving
his rosy night robe hanging on the sky.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>But Catalina saw none of this beauty.
Her eyes and her heart were blind with unreasonable
rage. Fleeing from the balcony,
she ran into the Myrtle Court.</p>

<p>Raising her pale little face to the fast-darkening
sky, she cried, "I shall never,
never, never dance again!"</p>

<p>With that, she threw her castanets into
the deep pool in the center of the court. They
sank quickly to the bottom, down, down in
a black circle. The magic castanets!</p>

<p>Not until several days later, when
Catalina's temper had cooled, did she suddenly
remember the old verse which her
grandmother had taught her:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Castanets, with magic spell,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Never lose or give or sell;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>If you do, then grief and strife</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Will follow you through all your life.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>What had she done? How could she have
thrown away the magic castanets?</p>

<p>Quickly Catalina returned to the Myrtle
Court. A palace attendant promised to
search the pool for her. But when he did,
the castanets were nowhere to be found.</p>

<p>The story goes that not until Catalina became
a very old lady did she recover the
castanets. And then nobody rightly knows
how it came about.</p>

<p>But what we do know is that never again
did Catalina see her sweetheart. For a year
after he had left her, Hamet was killed in
the wars.</p>

<p>If Catalina had not lost her temper, she
would not have lost the magic castanets.
And if she had not lost the magic castanets&mdash;well,
would her story, perhaps, have been
different?</p>

<h2>ANOTHER VISIT TO JUAN</h2>


<p>Several days passed before Pilar was able
to leave her house and go to Juan's shop&mdash;several
anxious days. Because that night,
her grandfather had grown worse, and she
had been obliged to call the doctor.</p>

<p>The doctor had been coming every day
since then, and Pilar could not leave her
grandfather's side. Neighbors had been
kind, helping with food and attentions.</p>

<p>Now that her grandfather was better,
Pilar realized that she must repay those
good neighbors. So this morning, as soon
as the burning Spanish sun arose, Pilar
arose, too.</p>

<p>She prepared her grandfather's breakfast
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
and made him comfortable in his bed.
Then she drank her thick, sweet chocolate,
and off she went to Juan's shop, taking along
the old wooden chest.</p>

<p>Juan could not help smiling when he saw
her enter, weighed down by her huge burden.
It looked to Juan as if the big chest
should really have been carrying the little
girl.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Se&ntilde;orita Pilar," he
laughed. "And where is the chest taking
you today?"</p>

<p>Pilar did not smile. Resting the chest
upon the counter, she said, "Grandfather
has been very ill since last I saw you, Se&ntilde;or
Juan."</p>

<p>"Ah, I am sorry, child," said Juan.</p>

<p>"But now he is much better," added Pilar
more cheerfully, "And I have brought you
what I promised."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>"The castanets?" asked Juan, looking at
her shrewdly.</p>

<p>"More than the castanets, Se&ntilde;or Juan,"
answered the little girl. "For they alone
will not pay you for all the money I now
need."</p>

<p>She started to open the chest, and Juan
started to shake his head. But Pilar caught
his arm, and her large, dark eyes pleaded
pitifully.</p>

<p>"Oh, take them, please, Se&ntilde;or Juan!" she
cried. "For I need a great deal of money!
The doctor says that Grandfather will not
be able to work for a long time."</p>

<p>She pulled out of the chest the Damascene
knife from Toledo, the tall comb from Barcelona,
the faded fan from Valladolid, the
ancient clock from El Escorial, and the
saucy bonnet from Segovia.</p>

<p>"Here, take them, please, se&ntilde;or," she said.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
"And also&mdash;" She put her hand inside the
chest and drew out the magic castanets.
"These, too," she whispered, "for I promised."</p>

<p>Juan looked at the old wooden clappers.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
Then he looked at Pilar. And quite abruptly
he turned around to the strong box where
he kept his money. He unlocked it and took
out some paper bills.</p>

<p>"Here, little Pilar," he said. "Here is the
money for you and your grandfather. I
shall keep the knife and the clock and the
fan, the comb, and the bonnet. But&mdash;" He
pushed away her hand which held the castanets.
"Keep those, since you love them so
much."</p>

<p>Pilar clasped the castanets to her heart
and her face lit up like a thousand candles.</p>

<p>"Oh, Se&ntilde;or Juan!" she sighed. "You are
so good!"</p>

<p>Juan patted her shoulder.</p>

<p>"It is all right, my child," he said. "And
if, later on, you are in need of more money,
bring me the castanets. I can sell them to
a dancing master who would like to buy
them. He is very fond of such antiques."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>Pilar did not answer right away. Then
she said in a sober voice, "Before I give up
the castanets, Se&ntilde;or Juan, I shall first bring
you all the rest of my souvenirs. The castanets
will be the very last to go. And how I
hope that I shall never, never have to part
with them!"</p>

<h2>FOUR OLD PAINTINGS</h2>


<p>The Moors said, "Three times three things
a woman must have: white skin, white teeth,
and white hands; black eyes, black brows,
and black lashes; rosy lips, rosy cheeks, and
rosy nails."</p>

<p>Little Pilar had all of these. She was a
Spanish beauty. But she was not only beautiful;
she was also useful. She could sew
and cook and take care of a house.</p>

<p>If you had asked Pilar how she had learned
to sew and to cook and to take care of a
house, she would have shrugged her shoulders
and answered, "I did not learn. I just
knew."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>She just knew, as she knew how to dance.</p>

<p>But poor Pilar had not been able to join
her dancing companions in the gardens or
the squares for many a day now. Her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
grandfather's health had not improved very
much, and Pilar could seldom leave him.</p>

<p>As time went on, Pilar watched the money
which Juan had given her gradually disappear,
and at last there was no more left.
But fortunately there were still souvenirs
left in the chest, and these Pilar took to
Juan. Four of the remaining souvenirs
were old paintings.</p>

<p>When Juan saw them, he remarked,
"These paintings are of four famous people.
Let me tell you their stories."</p>

<p>These are the stories he told:</p>


<p class="hcenter"><i>Luis de Leon of Salamanca</i></p>

<p>In the Middle Ages, when the University
of Salamanca (s&#259;l´&#551;-m&#259;ng´k&#551;) was one of
the finest in Europe, there lived a man
named Luis de Leon. He was a friar. He
was also one of Spain's great poets and a
professor at the university.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>One day as Fray Luis de Leon was teaching
his class, he was seized and thrown into
prison. This was during the time of the
inquisition, when people were arrested for
their religious beliefs.</p>

<p>Fray Luis remained in prison for many
years. When he returned to Salamanca,
everybody welcomed him, and all the important
townspeople came to the university to
hear him make a speech.</p>

<p>But Fray Luis did not make a speech. He
faced the schoolroom full of his pupils and
others who had come to hear him, and,
taking up the daily lesson, he remarked
simply, "As we were saying yesterday&mdash;"
just as if he had never been away!</p>

<p>Salamanca sits upon the banks of the
River Tormes (tôr´m&#257;s) across an old Roman
bridge. It is a city of domes and spires,
of quiet memories of art and culture.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p class="hcenter"><i>St. Teresa of Avila</i></p>

<p>Once upon a time, long, long ago, there
lived in the town of Avila (ä´ve&#772;&#781;-lä) a little
girl named Teresa. Often Teresa would
read stories to her brother. These stories
were not about fairies, kings, and queens,
nor even robbers. They were about saints.</p>

<p>Little Teresa wished very much to become
a saint and to live in heaven. So one day
she and her brother set off for the country
of the Moors. Their reason for doing this
was because they thought that they might
be beheaded.</p>

<p>But this great pleasure was to be denied
them. An uncle found them on the road and
brought them home. It is a blessing that he
did and that young Teresa was allowed to
grow up. For she became a very holy
woman, who did much good in the world.</p>

<p>The city of Avila seems to breathe the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
holiness of St. Teresa. It is surrounded by
a treeless desert and giant rocks. Its perfect
Roman walls clasp it tightly as if to
safeguard its mystery and charm.</p>

<p>Do you hear the ding-donging bells of the
many churches? They carry one off to

backs. Avila is an old-fashioned town.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>


<p class="hcenter"><i>The Cid of Valencia</i></p>

<p>"Godfather, please give me a colt. You
have so many. You will never miss one."</p>

<p>Rodrigo de Bivar (ro&#772;&#781;-dr&#275;´g&#333; de bevär´)
stood in the paddock beside his godfather,
Don Pedro, a priest of Burgos (bo&#862;or´g&#333;s).
They were watching the horses, mares, and
their colts running wild. How free and
beautiful they were, with their lovely manes
flowing in the breeze!</p>

<p>"You may choose the best for yourself,
godson," said Don Pedro.</p>

<p>Young Rodrigo's keen eyes followed each
graceful young horse as it passed. But he
said nothing. He said nothing until an
ugly, shaggy little animal came by.</p>

<p>Then he cried out, "This is the one I want,
godfather!"</p>

<p>His godfather gave him a look of disgust.</p>

<p>"Babieca! (babie´ca) (Foolish one!)" he
scolded. "This is indeed a stupid choice!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>Rodrigo was not dismayed. Smiling, he
said, "Babieca shall be my horse's name!"</p>

<p>It was this same Babieca, or Booby, who
carried Rodrigo de Bivar through his many
famous battles. It was Babieca, too, who is
supposed to have wept over his master when
the great warrior-lord died.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>For young Rodrigo became Spain's most
celebrated hero, the Cid, about whom songs
have been sung and tales have been spun.
Many of these are, of course, only romance
and legend. But the Cid did indeed live and
triumph.</p>

<p>One of his greatest victories was the conquest
of that rich and beautiful city, Valencia
(v&#551;-l&#277;n´sh&#301;-&#551;), which is still called Valencia
del Cid.</p>


<p class="hcenter"><i>Columbus of&mdash;Where?</i></p>

<p>"Please, a little food and shelter. We are
very hungry and tired!"</p>

<p>The man was Christopher Columbus, and
the child, Diego, his son. Weary and discouraged,
they had arrived at the monastery
of La Rabita.</p>

<p>For a long time, Christopher Columbus
had been trying to interest the Spanish court
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
in his scheme to sail across the unknown
ocean. He thought that by sailing west he
would reach Asia.</p>

<p>But the King and Queen were busy with
their struggles against the Moors, and they
would not listen to him.</p>

<p>The kind monks at the monastery of La
Rabita sheltered Columbus and his little son.
They also gave heed to his eager hopes and
plans, and at last Prior Perez of the monastery
wrote a letter to Queen Isabella.</p>

<p>As we well know, Queen Isabella made it
possible for Christopher Columbus to sail
across the ocean and discover America. But
nobody yet has really discovered Christopher
Columbus.</p>

<p>Where was he born? Some say in Italy,
others, in northern Spain. Perhaps Columbus
was a Jew who changed his religion and
nationality. This could well have been, because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
at that time the Jews in Spain were
being tortured and sent away from their
country.</p>

<p>When Columbus returned from his famous
voyage, he was received in Barcelona
by King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella.
They made him Lord High Admiral of the
Ocean Sea and Hereditary Viceroy of the
New World.</p>

<p>But after the death of the Queen, Columbus
was badly treated by King Ferdinand,
and he died in poverty and despair at a
miserable inn.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When Juan had finished telling the stories
about the four paintings, Pilar asked, "Will
you buy them from me, Se&ntilde;or Juan?"</p>

<p>Juan answered, "Yes, if you really must
sell them, Pilar. But I wish that you might
keep them, for they are very fine."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>"I need the money," said Pilar simply.</p>

<p>"Then why not let me sell those ugly castanets?"
inquired Juan. "The dancing
master will willingly pay for them."</p>

<p>"No, no!" cried Pilar. "They shall be the
last to go."</p>

<p>So Juan took the four paintings and gave
Pilar money for them. And now there remained
in the wooden chest only three souvenirs.
One was a bottle of old wine, one a
small dagger, and one the magic castanets.</p>

<h2>FIESTA</h2>


<p>Fiestas (fy&#277;s´täs) (festivals) and fairs
are the joy of the Spanish people. Some are
held upon saints' days. In Spain one celebrates
the birthday of the saint for whom
one is named.</p>

<p>Tonight there was a fiesta in Triana,
which is across the bridge from Seville. It
is where the gypsies live.</p>

<p>Pilar was on her way to Triana with a
group of her friends. She was dressed in
her dancing costume. She wanted to dance
and use her magic castanets. This would
be the last time she could do so. For of all
her mother's souvenirs, only the castanets
were now left. And tomorrow&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>But Pilar did not like to think about that
tomorrow. Juan had sold everything else
out of the wooden chest. Everything else
had gone, even the wooden chest itself&mdash;gone
to pay for food and medicines.</p>

<p>He had sold the very old bottle of sherry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
wine, which had come from a well-known cellar
of Jerez (ha&#772;&#781;-r&#257;th´), once called Scheriz.</p>

<p>In this cellar there is a cluster of huge
barrels, upon which are written noted
names, such as the Prince of Wales' and our
own President's. They contain wines made
in the year of each person's birth.</p>

<p>A family of well-trained mice lives in this
cellar. When the attendant rings a bell and
scatters bread upon the floor, these tiny
creatures run out from behind the barrels.</p>

<p>Juan had also sold the small dagger of
Moorish design. It had come from the town
of Cordoba (kôr´do&#772;&#781;-vä), once an important
center. The famous Mosque of Cordoba,
with its striped arches, was built by the
Moors. But it has since been made into a
Christian church.</p>

<p>King Charles V is supposed to have said
to the Christian builders, "You have built
what can be found anywhere, but you have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
spoiled what cannot be found anywhere else.</p>

<p>One sees in Cordoba
those broad-brimmed
hats which belong to
that part of Spain
called Andalucia (än´dä-lo&#862;o-th&#275;´ä).</p>

<p>A legend tells how
Andalucia received its
name. Every saint in
heaven had been given
a spot over which to rule&mdash;every one, except
poor little Saint Lucia. So she searched the
world for a country, but most of the world
had already been taken by other saints.</p>

<p>One day, however, she came to a land of
sunshine and flowers, with which she was
delighted. She asked if she might have it
for her own, and a mysterious voice answered
and said to her, "Anda, Lucia! (Go
there, Lucia!)"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>And that is why, the legend tells, this
sunny part of Spain is called Andalucia.</p>

<p>Seville, too, is in Andalucia; and now let
us go back to Seville and to Pilar.</p>

<p>Tonight Pilar had left her grandfather
for the first time in many evenings. A
neighbor had kindly offered to stay with him
while she went to the fiesta. Pilar's heart
had been crying out for music and dancing.</p>

<p>Across the bridge, over the Guadalquivir
(gwä´d&#259;l-kw&#301;v´&#7869;r) River, went the crowd of
young people. They passed the Torre del
Oro (tôr´ra&#772;&#781; d&#277;l &#333;´r&#333;) (Tower of Gold), where
treasure once was stored.</p>

<p>In Triana there are many pottery shops;
also there is a large American olive factory.
It is said that the best olives are grown in
sight of the Giralda Tower, which is in
Seville.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a><br /></span></p>

<p>At the fiesta, music and song filled the air.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
Lanterns were strung from poles. Booths
lined the square. Nuts and fruits and cakes
were sold. There were small wagons where
men fried long, golden cakes like the doughnut.</p>

<p>Shawls, laces, paintings, toys, and fans
for sale. Merry-go-rounds, sideshows,
dancing, and more dancing. Pilar and her
friends whirled about, kicking their legs,
pointing their toes, rolling their eyes, and
rippling their castanets.</p>

<p>At last, tired, but filled with rhythm and
harmony, the group started for home.</p>

<p>After Pilar had left the fiesta, however,
somebody asked about her. That somebody
was a great dancing master.</p>

<p>He asked, "Who was that little beauty
in the white costume trimmed with green?
She played a pair of golden-voiced castanets.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>But nobody in Triana knew where Pilar
lived, and, of course, her name is a common
one in Spain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>On the way home, Pilar's spirits began to
fall. She began to think of having to part
with her precious castanets. How she
wished that there might be some other way
of&mdash;!</p>

<p>Suddenly she remembered Tony&mdash;Tony,
the boy who had played bullfight with Juan
years ago. It was weeks now since Juan had
sent the old red cape to America and had
written to Tony.</p>

<p>Juan had said that Tony was rich and
generous and that he would help Pilar and
her grandfather because he would remember
Pilar's mother. But Pilar had begun to
wonder whether Tony really would.</p>

<p>When she reached home, all the excitement
of the fiesta had worn away. She was
very unhappy. Tomorrow she must give up
the castanets. Juan had said that he could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
sell them to a dancing master, who paid
handsomely for antiques.</p>

<p>Pilar started to undress. She unpinned
the brooch that fastened her costume at the
throat. And all at once, her face lit up with
a wonderful new idea.</p>

<p>She would take this brooch to Juan tomorrow.
It was her own, part of her dancing
costume. But she would far rather part
with it than with her mother's castanets.</p>

<p>The brooch was a small painting called a
miniature. It was the likeness of young
Prince Alfonso, the brother of Queen Isabella
of Spain.</p>

<p>Pilar hurried off to bed. And while she
sleeps, let us listen to the "Mystery of the
Young Prince."</p>

<h2>THE MYSTERY OF THE YOUNG PRINCE</h2>


<p>Alfonso was only a boy. But some day he
would be king, for he was next in line to his
brother, King Henry. After him came his
sister, Isabella, a beautiful little girl, earnest
and thoughtful.</p>

<p>Alfonso felt himself to be Isabella's knight
and protector. He had learned to ride and
to use his sword like a true Spanish cavalier.</p>

<p>One day at twilight Isabella sat at the window,
embroidering a Moorish design upon
a bit of gold cloth. Alfonso, his studies over
for the day, was reading to her.</p>

<p>Better than anything else, the Prince
loved to read&mdash;which may have been the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
reason for what happened later&mdash;at least,
for what is supposed to have happened. For
nobody rightly knows the truth of the bitter
story.</p>

<p>As the two children sat together, enjoying
the happiest moment of their day, one
of the King's spies secretly watched and
listened.</p>

<p>He heard the Princess Isabella say,
"Enough of that for now, Alfonso. Come.
Read my favorite book."</p>

<p>Alfonso put down the book which he had
been reading, and the spy noted well its
title, "The Odyssey (&#335;d´&#301;-s&#301;)." He also had
noted something else. Always before the
Prince turned a page, he first moistened his
finger with his tongue.</p>

<p>Squinting his eyes, the spy smiled wickedly
to himself and stole away.</p>

<p>Several nights later, this same spy crept
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
into the Prince's chamber and, feeling cautiously
about, he at last found what he
sought. It was a book, "The Odyssey."</p>

<p>Working with agile fingers, he opened the
book, and upon each page he smeared a
deadly poison. Then he returned the book
to its place and left the room as quietly as
he had entered.</p>

<p>Now trouble and discontent filled the country.
Some of the people were not pleased
with King Henry, and they wanted to place
young Alfonso upon the throne.</p>

<p>The Prince and his sister began to live
through turbulent times, and their peaceful
hours together were over. Alfonso was
thrown into prison, then suddenly freed
again, to become an important figure in the
kingdom.</p>

<p>He was told that soon he would be crowned
king, for the rebels were going to overthrow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
his brother Henry. Whispered plans, secret
schemes stirred in the air like poisonous insects.
And the poisoned book lay where the
spy had left it. The Prince found little time
for reading.</p>

<p>But today he had managed to meet his
sister, and the two were very happy to be together
again for an hour of quiet reading.</p>

<p>Alfonso picked up the book, "The Odyssey,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
but Isabella said, "No, not that one,
Alfonso. Today let us hear this most interesting
novel. It tells why the wind blows,
why we smell and taste and hear, all in the
form of a story."</p>

<p>She smiled and handed him the other book.
Good-naturedly Alfonso put down "The Odyssey."
Had he but known it, he put from
him death!</p>

<p>Soon afterwards, the prince was again
torn from his sister, this time to live through
one of the most dramatic events in his
stormy young life.</p>

<p>One day a splendid procession made its
way into the town of Avila. Among the
cavaliers rode Prince Alfonso. His horse
richly decked, he sat stiffly upon the saddle,
clothed in armor. His boyish face was grave
and stern.</p>

<p>As he passed, the people cried out, "Long
live King Alfonso!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>A throne had been erected out upon the
plains. On this throne sat what appeared
to be a king. He held a scepter, and the
crown upon his head gleamed brightly in
the sun.</p>

<p>But as the cavalcade drew closer, it was
seen that the figure had fallen over on its
side like a sawdust doll. And indeed, that
is just what it was&mdash;a scarecrow, made to
represent King Henry.</p>

<p>The Prince and his followers stood upon
the platform. A colorful crowd had
gathered about them&mdash;monks in brown,
monks in white and black, lords in bright-hued
mantles, Moors with turbans on their
heads, peasants, beggars, young and old.</p>

<p>Bugles rang out, and drums rolled. The
little Prince stood, proudly royal, in his
armor. His blond hair showed under the
visor which had been pushed back from his
head.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the Archbishop snatched the crown
from the head of the scarecrow king and
roared, "Thus lose the royal dignity which
you have guarded ill."</p>

<p>And one of the cavaliers roughly kicked
the figure off its throne. There were cries
and shouts and some gasps of horror.
Alfonso was seated upon the throne and
crowned King of Avila.</p>

<p>Petty wars, robberies, and murders followed.
Part of the country was in favor of
King Henry, while the rebels supported
Alfonso. A terrible battle took place in
Toledo. Houses were burned and people
massacred.</p>

<p>A few days later, Alfonso arrived in the
town.</p>

<p>Those who had burned and massacred
bowed down to the young king, saying, "We
will fight for your cause if you will approve
this massacre."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

  </table>

<p>Alfonso replied, "God forbid that I should
approve such horrors!"</p>

<p>The next thing he knew, Alfonso's country
was plunged into war. The rebels were
to meet the King's men in conflict.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>The night before the battle Alfonso, rest-less
and unhappy, paced his chamber. Why
must men fight? Why must they kill one another?
The Prince loved power; but better
than power, he loved peace.</p>

<p>Wherever he went, he always took along
some of his books. Now upon the table lay
several, and among them was "The Odyssey."
Alfonso laid his hand upon his favorite
work and was about to take it up when
he let it fall again.</p>

<p>No, he could not read tonight. His heart
was too heavy. He missed his sister and,
too, he kept thinking of their future&mdash;a
stormy prospect. For Isabella no doubt
would be forced to marry some distasteful
noble. And he? With enemies upon all
sides, if he were not killed in war, he might
well be murdered in his sleep.</p>

<p>Next day in full armor, his sword drawn,
the boy King of Avila went out to meet his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
foe. Fighting bravely, by his soldiers, it is
said that he was last to leave the battle.</p>

<p>There came a time when Alfonso set forth
upon a journey, accompanied by a group of
nobles. Among his traveling companions
were several of the King's followers, one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
them that same spy who had smeared poison
upon the leaves of Alfonso's book.</p>

<p>As evening overtook the party of travelers,
they drew rein in the town of Cardenosa,
and planned to stop there for the night.</p>

<p>As usual, Alfonso had brought along his
books. But too often had his enemies been
disappointed, so now they planned a trick.
It was a trick which would force the Prince
into their cruel trap.</p>

<p>They removed all but one of Alfonso's
books from his chamber. The one left was
placed in plain view upon the table. It was
"The Odyssey."</p>

<p>Wondering what had become of the others,
but too weary to find out, the Prince
settled himself to read before retiring for
the night. As he opened the book he smiled,
remembering Isabella and how she had always
urged him to read something else.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, tonight he might do as he pleased,
for he was quite alone. Tonight he might
read "The Odyssey," which he had not
opened for so long.</p>

<p>Page after page he turned with a finger
moistened by his tongue. And an hour
passed.</p>

<p>Late during the night, a messenger rode
madly into the town of Segovia where the
Princess Isabella was living.</p>

<p>"The King of Avila is dying!" the messenger
gasped. "He calls for his sister, the
Princess Isabella!"</p>

<p>Isabella rode furiously through the night
and when she reached Cardenosa, she was
met by the Archbishop of Toledo. He held
out his hand to her, and in his face there was
pity and grief. Before he even told her,
Isabella knew that her beloved brother was
dead.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>Some claimed that enemies had given him
poisoned fish. Others believed that he had
died of a fever. Still others told the story
which you have just heard. But whether or
not it is true will remain a mystery forever.</p>

<p>There is a wonderful cathedral in Burgos,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
whose Gothic spires point upward like lace
fingers. They point to a hill above the city,
upon which rests the Miraflores Chapel.</p>

<p>Inside this chapel is a beautiful statue of
a boy. He wears a royal mantle and kneels
before a praying desk. The boy is Alfonso.</p>

<p>When Henry died, it was the earnest little
Isabella who became queen. Today in
the Cathedral of Granada&mdash;that white and
gold and silver cathedral&mdash;are the tombs of
Queen Isabella and her husband, King Ferdinand.</p>

<p>They are carved of marble, and Isabella's
pillow sinks down deeper than Ferdinand's
with the weight of her head. They say that
this is because her head held more brains
than his.</p>

<p>We know she was a wise, good queen and
we love her because she helped Christopher
Columbus and listened to his dreams.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>But just suppose Alfonso had not died.
Suppose, instead, that he had lived and
ruled. Do you believe Alfonso would have

as did his sister Isabella? And, had
he not, where should we be today?</p>

<h2>A STOUT SWEETHEART</h2>


<p>The sale of the Prince Alfonso brooch
brought Pilar and her grandfather enough
to live on for a week. Then once more Pilar
was faced with having to give up the castanets.</p>

<p>Juan seemed eager to have them now.
He said that the great dancing master had
shown much interest in them.</p>

<p>This dancing master was the same one
who had inquired about Pilar at the fiesta
that night in Triana, though Juan, of course,
did not know it.</p>

<p>At last the fatal day arrived when Pilar
could no longer delay her visit to Juan's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
shop. What she would do after this last sale
she had no idea. Unless her grandfather's
health improved so that he might work
again, things looked black for both of them.</p>

<p>Pilar went out onto the balcony of her
house. Girl-draped balconies are as natural
in Spain as donkey-dotted roads and child-filled
doorways.</p>

<p>Pilar gazed down on the street. The
morning was golden. Church bells clanged,
and a knife grinder was piping on an Arab
reed. A broom-maker squatted on the pavement
across the way.</p>

<p>Pilar's eyes were full of tears as she took
up the castanets and went with them into
her grandfather's room.</p>

<p>"I am going out, Grandfather," she said.</p>

<p>But she mentioned nothing about selling
the castanets. She could not trust herself
to speak. However, her grandfather saw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
them in her hands,
and his old eyes
brightened.</p>

  </div>

<p>"Some day I shall
tell you&mdash;stories&mdash;about&mdash;those&mdash;"
he
breathed. "Your
mother&mdash;loved&mdash;them&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do not talk now,
Grandfather. It will tire you," said Pilar.</p>

<p>She wanted to be off, to have it all over
with as quickly as possible. She knew that
if her grandfather told her a story about
the castanets, it would be even harder to part
with them. Poor Pilar! If she had listened
to just one of those legends, she would not
have dared to sell the wooden clappers.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, dear Grandfather."</p>

<p>She kissed him and left.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>As she opened the gate that led out of the
small court of their house, she ran into a
stout, grinning boy.</p>

<p>"Oh, Pepe!" cried Pilar. "When did you
get back?"</p>

<p>All summer Pepe had been away on a
journey. Now here he was home again to
follow and annoy Pilar.</p>

<p>Pepe liked to make believe that he was
a cavalier. He liked to imitate his older
brothers. For in Spain a man courts his lady
in a very romantic way. He stands outside
her window at night, and sometimes he sings
love songs to her.</p>

<p>This funny, stout little Pepe often met
Pilar at school and walked home with her.
Once he had even tried to sing under her
window. But a neighbor thought it was a
tomcat howling and threw a bucket of water
on his head.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>Today Pilar was in no mood to be followed
about. Today was a bitter day in her life.
For this time there was no more hope of
keeping the castanets. She knew that at
last she must really give them up to Juan.</p>

<p>She started to walk on ahead of Pepe.
But he followed her.</p>

<p>He puffed as he jogged along behind her,
calling out, "Wait for me, Pilar. I have
much to tell you. I have been to far-away
places. Ho! Listen, Pilar. I have been to
Algeciras (&#259;l´je&#772;&#781;-s&#275;´r&#551;s) and to the Rock of
Gibraltar."</p>

<p>Pilar thought Pepe himself looked like the
Rock of Gibraltar. She had seen pictures
of the great, solid rock. It belongs to England,
and just across Gibraltar Bay is the
lazy little Spanish seaport town of Algeciras.</p>

<p>Pilar usually liked to listen to Pepe's tales
of his travels. The boy's father often took
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
him away to places where they saw interesting
and curious sights.</p>

<p>But today it was impossible to pay attention.
She tried to get away from Pepe and
walked faster and faster.</p>

<p>He followed doggedly, breaking into a
gallop and crying out in little gasps, "Hi!
But listen, Pilar."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>And so eager was he to reach her that he
did not notice where he was going, and all
of a sudden&mdash;pff! bang! He had crashed
into a man wearing what looked like a ballet
skirt of tin cans. They were milk cans.</p>

<p>They shot in all directions. The man began
to scold Pepe and to wave his arms
about. A crowd gathered, and in the noise
and excitement, Pilar escaped from her stout
little sweetheart.</p>

<p>Seville's great cathedral was just across
the street&mdash;a massive giant, squatting in the
sun. Pilar went inside. It was cool and
peaceful there. Works of art filled the vast
church&mdash;paintings, fine carvings, and the
stately tomb of Christopher Columbus.</p>

<p>Pilar knelt before the altar, where a curious
ceremony takes place every year. This
ceremony is called "The Dance of the Six
Boys."</p>

<p>Pilar prayed, her eyes closed, her lips moving.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
And clasped to her heart were the castanets&mdash;the
magic castanets, about which
another legend was woven&mdash;a legend around
this very Dance of the Six.</p>

<h2>DANCE OF THE SIX</h2>

<p class="center">(<span class="smcap">A Legend of the Castanets</span>)</p>


<p>The chorus had been sung, and now they
were dancing to the steady, clicking rhythm
of their castanets. It was a dignified dance,
done by young boys wearing silken pages'
costumes and wide, plumed hats.</p>

<p>Everybody felt the solemn beauty of the
ceremony, and a hushed reverence had fallen
over the cathedral. Two old people, a woman
with a black shawl thrown over her head
and an old man with a tanned, leathery face,
sat silently weeping.</p>

<p>Fernando, their son, moved among those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
graceful figures beneath the altar. He was
a part of the royal Dance of the Six, called
the Sevillana.</p>

<p>How proud were these old people of their
son Fernando! How happy to know that,
each year, he would take his place in this
age-old ceremony of their forefathers, in the
dance which had been performed for centuries
in Seville's cathedral!</p>

<p>For in the far distant past, the Pope, hearing
about the Sevillana, wished to see for
himself what sort of dance it was. In those
days, it would have been considered shocking
for girls to dance before the Pope. So
six boys were taught the steps of the Sevillana
and taken to the Vatican in Rome.</p>

<p>Here they danced, dressed in their beautiful
silken costumes. The Pope was so well
pleased that he granted permission to use
this dance during certain ceremonies at the
cathedral. But the privilege was to last only
so long as the boys' costumes lasted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

  </table>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>Today these costumes are still in use. But
what a deal of patching and mending must
have taken place during those hundreds of
years!</p>

<p>When the dance was over, Fernando went
into his room and pulled off his quaint,
plumed hat. The reverent little dancer had
changed to a furious, red-faced youth. He
threw the hat down on the floor in a fit of
anger.</p>

<p>"Never!" he cried. "Never will I dance
it again!"</p>

<p>His sister Maria stood trembling at the
door.</p>

<p>"Do not say that, Fernando," she begged.
"Think of our parents. You would break
their hearts were you never to dance in the
cathedral again. These past three days have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
been for them the happiest of their lives."</p>

<p>"I shall never dance again," repeated Fernando
firmly. "It is girls' work, and I am a
boy. I shall run away and work with men&mdash;and
be a man!"</p>

<p>Fernando picked up his castanets, which
had fallen to the floor.</p>

<p>"Miguel will take my place in the chorus,"
he said. "I shall have no more use for these
castanets, and so I shall give them&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No! No!" cried Fernando's sister. She
ran over to him and caught him by the arm.
"You must never give away those castanets.
Surely you have heard about their magic
power and the legends attached to them.
Ill luck to him who loses or gives away&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" scoffed Fernando. "I do not
believe such tales. They are old women's
twaddle!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps," agreed his sister. "Yet remember
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
what our grandmother once told
us. She said that the castanets have always
been a power for good. And whenever we
do things which we should not do, they bring
misfortune to us and to our family."</p>

<p>Then she recited:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Castanets, with magic spell,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Never lose or give or sell;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>If you do, then grief and strife</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Will follow you through all your life.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Yes, I know," said Fernando shortly.
"But," and he grinned, "I shall change that
verse to:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'<i>Castanets, you have no spell;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>If I lose or give or sell,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>I shall live in manly strife,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Not be a sissy all my life!</i>'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>One night many years later, this same Fernando,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
now a man, glided along in a boat on
a river near the border of France. With him
were several other men, and all of them were
smugglers.</p>

<p>Fernando had long lived in the Pyrenees (p&#301;r´e&#772;&#781;-n&#275;z) Mountains.
He had joined a band of people who secretly smuggled forbidden
goods from Spain to France in the
dead of night. They led a dangerous life
and were always in fear of the customs men.</p>

<p>As their boat now moved gently along the
water, Fernando's companions slept. All
night they had labored, and they were weary.
But Fernando could not sleep. Somehow his
thoughts kept taking him to Seville, to his
parents and his sister Maria. What had become
of them?</p>

<p>In all these years he had heard no word
from them, and until now, he had barely
given them a thought. But tonight&mdash;How
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
strange that they should creep into his mind!</p>

<p>A shot rang out hideously. The customs
men were after them! Another shot! And
another and another! One by one, the
smugglers in the little boat crumpled where
they sat. Then the small craft itself began
to sink&mdash;down, down.</p>

<p>All was silent upon the surface of the water.
All was silent for a long time, and then
Fernando, holding to a floating board, slowly
raised his head.</p>

<p>The morning had begun to dawn over the
Spanish Pyrenees. A hoarse church bell
rang out. Fernando looked about him. The
customs men had gone back to France. The
smugglers, too, had gone, but not to France;
to the bottom of the river.</p>

<p>Fernando swam to shore, and the next day
he set off for Seville. He had one aim: to
find his family and to try to make up for the
heartache he had caused them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>But Fernando was never to see his parents
again. Long since the old people had died,
and only his sister Maria remained. He
found her living in a poor and squalid alley.
Yet when he walked into her shabby room,
she did not seem in the least surprised to
see him.</p>

<p>"I knew that you would come back, Fernando,"
she said quietly. "I expected you."</p>

<p>Puzzled, he started to speak, but she silenced
him.</p>

<p>Then thrusting her hand inside her blouse,
she drew out the magic castanets, saying,
"They were brought back to me, Fernando!"</p>

<p>Fernando stood fixed to the spot, his eyes
upon the old clappers, which he had given
away so many years ago in a fit of boyish
rage. Then a sudden curious idea occurred
to him.</p>

<p>"When were they returned to you?" he
asked Maria.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>She told him, and he knew then that it had
been upon the very same night when his life
had been spared, out there upon those dangerous
waters&mdash;the very same night when he
had been thinking so earnestly of his
family.</p>

<p>His sister listened while he told her of his
many adventures as a smuggler. He promised
to give it all up, to help her, and to become
an honest man.</p>

<p>"For," he ended, laughing, "there is an old
Basque saying, 'If a smuggler is an honest
man, then legends are the truth.'"</p>

<p>"But surely, Fernando," said his sister,
"you must believe in the legends of the castanets
after what has happened to us."</p>

<p>Fernando shook his head.</p>

<p>"I believe only in the power for good," he
replied.</p>

<p>Some years later, Fernando had a little son
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
of his own who danced in the cathedral of
Seville. And do you see those two old people
who sit there watching, solemn-eyed and
happy?</p>

<p>They are Fernando and his wife, and they
are very proud that their boy is taking his
place in this age-old ceremony of their forefathers.</p>

<h2>PILAR'S GRANDFATHER REMEMBERS</h2>


<p>After Pilar went out, her grandfather lay
thinking. Somehow the old man felt better
today. He did not fall asleep as soon as Pilar
left the house.</p>

<p>He began to wonder where she had gone
and why she had taken the castanets with
her. He knew that she had been obliged to
sell many of her mother's souvenirs, so that
they might live. But he hoped that soon he
would be able again to provide for his granddaughter
and himself.</p>

<p>"Suppose Pilly has gone out to sell the castanets,"
he thought.</p>

<p>The idea frightened him. Yet he tried to
tell himself that he was just a foolish old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
man, to believe in a fairy tale about the
charm of a pair of castanets.</p>

<p>Still he could not help remembering the
legends which had been handed down
through his family.</p>

<p>He lay dreaming, and before him passed
the days when Pilar's mother had been
young. Her name had been Carmen Pilar
Innocentia Gonzales, but she had been known
as "Carmen, the Little Spanish Dancer."</p>

<p>As a little girl, she had been just such a
graceful dancer as Pilar. And one day a
great teacher from Madrid had seen her and
had taken her away to study in the capital.</p>

<p>But before that, she had spent much time
on the streets of Seville. Her father could
still see her playing there with her little
friend Tony, who had lived next door.</p>

<p>Tony and his comrades had often staged a
bullfight. Tony would be the brave torero
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
(to&#772;&#781;-r&#257;´r&#333;) or fighter, while all the neighbors
would gather round to watch the sport.</p>

<p>When Tony would plunge his make-believe
sword into the make-believe bull, everyone
would cheer loudly.</p>

      <span style="font-size:.7em">BOYS PLAYING BULLFIGHT</span>

  </table>

<p>Bullfighting is still Spain's favorite sport,
though recently football has arrived there.
The Spanish call it "fútbol," and it has become
very popular.</p>

<p>But Tony had always wanted to be a torero.
Pilar's grandfather lay smiling as he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
thought of that same Tony, now a wealthy
tobacco merchant living in America. He
was far from being a bullfighter today.</p>

<p>However, when Pilar's mother, Carmen,
grew older, she had been courted by a young
man who was a bullfighter. The memory of
this young man brought to mind again the
fear of losing the castanets.</p>

<p>For Pilar's grandfather recalled a very
real and dramatic story about Carmen and
Pedro, the young torero.</p>

<h2>BULLFIGHT IN MADRID</h2>

<p class="center">(<span class="smcap">A Legend of the Castanets</span>)</p>


<p>In the opera, "Carmen," a girl who works
in a cigarette factory of Seville, is loved by
a torero, or bullfighter.</p>

<p>The Carmen of this story did not work in
a cigarette factory. She was a dancer. But
she, too, had an admirer who was a torero.
His name was Pedro.</p>

<p>In a few days Pedro was going to fight in
a most important corrida, or bullfight, in the
city of Madrid. He was going to fight a very
fierce and savage bull. But, strange to say,
Pedro did not want to kill that bull.</p>

<p>Now, as a general rule, toreros would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
rather kill bulls than be killed by them, for
which you cannot blame the toreros.</p>

<p>In this case, however, it was different.
Pedro's father had raised this great bull,
Rey, and Pedro was very fond of the animal.
In a few days he was expected to go into
the arena and kill his pet.</p>

<p>Often Pedro took his little friend Carmen
to visit Rey, who lived in a field outside the
city. Today they had come out for the last
time before the famous bullfight was to take
place.</p>

<p>Both were very sad. Carmen, too, had
grown to love Rey, and the big creature
seemed fond of her.</p>

<p>Sometimes the girl would practice upon
her castanets out in the field. And always
when Rey heard the clicking song of the instruments,
he would come up close to the
young couple and stand quietly listening.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>Do you wonder that this was a sorrowful
day in the lives of Carmen and Pedro?</p>

<p>"If only we could think of some way to
save him!" sighed Carmen.</p>

<p>She and Pedro sat upon a fence in the
field. Around them rose mountains, hazy in
the sun. Small stone houses cuddled among
old scrub oak trees.</p>

<p>Suddenly Pedro's eyes sparkled. "I have
it!" he cried. "I have a plan! Do you remember
the bull whose life was saved during
a bullfight, because he came to his owner
when he was called?"</p>

<p>Carmen nodded. She remembered well.
All Spain had heard of it.</p>

<p>"Then why should not Rey, too, be given
this chance?" asked Pedro. "Why should
he not be spared if he answers a call?"</p>

<p>"But who will call him?" asked Carmen.</p>

<p>"You," answered Pedro. "You, with your
castanets."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>"Like this," said Carmen, and she started
to play.</p>

<p>Softly she played, then more and more
loudly, until the great bull appeared at the
other end of the field. He stood looking at
the boy and the girl and, all at once, he
started toward them, like a big, friendly
dog.</p>

<p>"You see!" exclaimed Pedro joyfully.
"Now on Sunday, when I am fighting with
him in the arena, you, from the audience,
will play your castanets as you just did. If
he turns and goes to you, I am sure that the
judges will spare his life."</p>

<p>"This is a wonderful plan, Pedro," smiled
the lovely little Carmen. "And I am certain
that it will succeed, because, you see&mdash;" She
hesitated for a moment. Then she continued,
"Because these castanets are enchanted!"</p>

<p>"Enchanted?" Pedro laughed. "That cannot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
be! Yet when you play them, it is I who
am enchanted, my Carmen!"</p>

<p>Carmen did not laugh, however. She
looked down soberly at her castanets.</p>

<p>"Legends are told in our family," she said,
"about the magic power of these castanets.
Whenever one of us has lost or sold or given
them away, misfortune has overtaken us."</p>

<p>Whereupon, she recited this verse:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Castanets, with magic spell,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Never lose or give or sell;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>If you do, then grief and strife</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Will follow you through all your life.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Then whatever happens, do not lose them
before next Sunday," warned Pedro, smiling.</p>

<p>As the young couple arose to go, Carmen
gave a start.</p>

<p>"Did you see a figure sneak out from behind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
that tree and disappear?" she asked
Pedro.</p>

<p>"No, I did not," he answered. "And you
are full of mystery today, little Carmen!"
He was laughing at her again. "Come. Let
us go home now before you see a ghost."</p>

<p>But Carmen had been right. There had
indeed been a figure behind that tree&mdash;someone
with very sharp ears, who had listened to
all they had said.</p>

<p>He was no mystery&mdash;this figure&mdash;but a
very real person. He was another torero,
jealous of Pedro, who had won the love of
Carmen&mdash;jealous, too, because Pedro had
won popularity as a fighter, while he had
not.</p>

<p>Carmen thought she recognized this man.
Yet she was not altogether sure, and on the
way home, Pedro talked her out of her fears.</p>

<p>Happily they started toward Madrid, unaware
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
of the terrible plan which this jealous
torero was beginning to lay.</p>

<p>On they drove through a flat land of many
vineyards. They passed small white houses
with tiled hats on, and a village cut out of
the landscape by a lazy hand and colored
carelessly. Soon they entered Madrid.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>Madrid is a modern city of tram cars and
toots and traffic. In the summer time,
Madrid is like a faded, old duchess, who
clicks her fan and squats in the sun. She
is dressed in handsome plazas, fountains,
and parks.</p>

<p>But should you chance to walk into a narrow
side street, you might catch Madrid in
her alley mood. Then she is a simple
peasant.</p>

<p>Madrid is the capital, center, and heart of
Spain. Pedro, the torero, had lived there all
his life. But little Carmen had only recently
arrived in the big city.</p>

<p>Upon the Sunday of Pedro's great bullfight,
Carmen awoke early. Her heart
pounded with excitement. Today she and
her magic castanets were to try to save the
life of Pedro's beloved Rey.</p>

<p>But suppose Rey would not listen to her?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
Suppose he would not come to her when she
played? The noisy arena would be far different
from the quiet fields where she was
accustomed to calling him. He would be
frightened, furious, and fierce.</p>

<p>Bullfights do not start until four o'clock
in the afternoon. Then the sun is getting
ready to go to bed, and Spaniards are getting
up from their siestas, or naps.</p>

<p>Carmen drove to the bullfight with Pedro's
mother.</p>

<p>As they passed the Prado (prä´d&#333;),
Madrid's beautiful art gallery, Carmen
thought, "This Prado is a heaven of art,
while the corrida, only a few blocks away, is
a hades of suffering!"</p>

<p>She began to worry. And what girl would
not have worried? For no matter how brave
a torero may be, it is never certain that he
will come out of the arena alive. Why, even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
his own pet, might today take Pedro's
life!</p>

<p>Through the many fine streets of Madrid
they drove, and at last they reached the bull
ring. Crowds were swarming in through
the gates of the big, round arena. Carmen
and Pedro's mother, silent and sad-faced,
made their way to their box.</p>

<p>The old lady wore a tall comb in her hair
and a lace mantilla over it. She opened her
fan with a click and started to fan herself.
Carmen did the same, as, indeed, everyone
else was doing. The sun had been very slow
about going to bed.</p>

<p>Over on the opposite side of the arena,
the poor people sat in the sun, because those
seats were cheaper. There was an air of
excitement. The band played the "Toreador's (t&#335;r´e&#772;&#781;-ä-dôr´) Song" from
"Carmen," and then the fight began.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>There were five toreros and five bulls before
Pedro's turn came. Pedro was to be
last on the program.</p>

<p>Everything seemed to swim before Carmen's
eyes during the performances of these
other men and bulls. The whole thing was
a sea of fluttering fans, sickly blue light,
and waving red cloaks.</p>

<p>Then at last Pedro entered the ring. How
big and handsome he looked in his colorful
costume! He carried the red cape with
which he was going to tease the bull.</p>

<p>But before that time, the bull would first
be angered by men with sharp sticks and by
other men on horseback.</p>

<p>Look! The gate is swinging open now,
and here is Rey! Snorting, rolling his fine
eyes, the magnificent creature gallops into
the center of the arena and stands, bewildered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly Carmen cannot look to see her
dear friend tortured. She hides her eyes,
her delicate little white hands held in front
of her face.</p>

<p>But when she hears the crowd yelling,
"Pedro! Pedro! Olé! Olé!" she knows
that she must uncover her eyes, for soon it
will be her turn to act.</p>

<p>A cry from the crowd. The bull has
charged and has caught young Pedro by the
coat. But Pedro is quick. He finds his feet
and twists himself to safety. The crowd
cheers loudly.</p>

<p>Backward and forward he dances like a
graceful reed, playing with the great beast,
and the crowd are wild at his skill. Some
throw their hats into the ring.</p>

<p>But Carmen sees the fury and the pain in
Rey's eyes. He is wounded. He is frantic.
She knows that now her turn has really
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
come and she must call to him with her castanets.
There is no time to lose.</p>

<p>Oh, will he remember those peaceful fields
and come to her when she plays? For if he
does, it has been arranged that he shall live.</p>

<p>But should he not, the end must be the
same with Rey as with every other bull in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
every other fight. Pedro will have to plunge
a dagger into the head of his friend.</p>

<p>"Oh, let us win!" prays little Carmen, and
she opens her bag where she keeps her castanets.</p>

<p>The magic castanets are gone!</p>

<p>For a moment the world turns around in
a crazy whirl. Fear clutches sharply at Carmen's
heart. The beast is blind with rage.
Soon Pedro will be obliged to make the final
dagger thrust or&mdash;!</p>

<p>What must Pedro think? That she, his
faithful little Carmen, has betrayed him and
Rey?</p>

<p>Where are the castanets? Carmen knows
well that she brought them with her. Someone
has stolen them.</p>

<p>Suddenly Carmen remembers the figure
she saw behind the tree that day in the
meadow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>Down there, close to the fence, she sees
the same man! It is the jealous torero.</p>

<p>He passes by, his set face wickedly content,
and to Carmen's keen ears comes a familiar
sound. From the man's pocket, faint,
yet unmistakable, she hears the click of her
castanets.</p>

<p>Carmen is out of her seat, past the guards,
and inside that dangerous arena. A gasp
goes through the audience&mdash;a horrified
shudder. But Carmen, her black eyes snapping,
is as dangerous now as any wild bull.</p>

<p>She has caught the man by the arm, swung
him around, and snatched from his pocket
her castanets.</p>

<p>Now she stands very still. With her small
body drawn up straight and taut, she begins
to play.</p>

<p>Pedro is fighting desperately. But everybody
knows that soon it must be man or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
beast. The torero must kill or be killed. The
audience is breathless.</p>

<p>Carmen's castanets sing shrilly, with a
rolling trill, and, all at once, Rey lifts his
massive head and listens. The call is sweet.
It speaks to him of pleasant things.</p>

<p>What shall he do? Obey that call and follow?
Or shall he stay and fight it out with
all his sharp-horned strength until the end?</p>

<p>A frenzied murmur issues from the crowd.
Slowly the people rise together in their seats,
as if a mountain heaved. The bull has
turned and now begins to trot toward Carmen's
side.</p>

<p>A woman shrieks. Another faints. But
proudly Carmen stands, bringing magic
rhythm out of her magic castanets. And
then she starts to walk away, her wooden
clappers coaxing like the Piper's reed and
urging Rey to follow her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>He does. The huge beast, like a docile
dog, allows the girl with her charm-sound,
to lead him out of the arena&mdash;out of death
and into life.</p>

<p>Little Carmen has won.</p>

<h2>WHERE IS PILAR?</h2>


<p>When Pilar left the cathedral, she hurried
toward the Street of the Serpents. She
would have to be quick. It was growing late,
and her grandfather would be waiting for
her.</p>

<p>As soon as she had sold the castanets to
Juan, she would shop at the market. Then
she would go home and cook the dinner.</p>

<p>She made herself think of the good things
she would cook. But her eyes filled with
tears. How could she think of eating when
her precious castanets were soon to be gone?</p>

<p>Besides, what would she and her grandfather
live on, after this money was spent?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
Would they be obliged to ask for charity?
Pilar shuddered.</p>

<p>The sound of a hurdy-gurdy came from
the Murillo Garden as she passed. She remembered
how she used to dance there every
evening before her grandfather had become
ill.</p>

<p>Her friends were dancing there now&mdash;all
of them: Maria, Guadalupe, Teresa&mdash;yes,
even Baby Dolores, happy, carefree, whirling
about in their dance.</p>

<p>They had no troubles. They could stay
out, dancing, singing, playing as long as
they pleased.</p>

<p>She would join them. She must dance just
once more to her golden-voiced castanets&mdash;just
once more before she gave them up to
Juan!</p>

<p>Pilar entered the garden.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, at home Pilar's grandfather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
awoke. He had been dreaming. He had
dreamed of that eventful bullfight when his
daughter Carmen had saved the life of Pedro's
bull, Rey.</p>

<p>Carmen had later married Pedro, and
Pilar was their child. But both had passed
away, leaving their little girl in the old
man's care.</p>

<p>What was keeping Pilar now? Where had
she gone, and what was taking her such a
long time?</p>

<p>Her grandfather began to worry. He
raised himself on the pillow. Dusk had
fallen. The room was growing dark. Yet
he could discern a white object lying on the
floor just inside the door. Why, it looked
like a letter. But few letters ever arrived at
this house. Still it was a letter!</p>

<p>Oh, if Pilar would only come home! She
had never been so late before.</p>

<p>"Suppose," he thought, "she has sold the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
magic castanets, and something terrible has
happened to her! Suppose&mdash;"</p>

  <table border="0" cellpadding="0" width="680">

      <td>

      <span style="font-size:.7em">TOLEDO</span>

  </table>

<p>But he quickly laughed at his foolish fears,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
and just then the door swung open and Pilar
burst in.</p>

<p>She was weeping bitterly, her arm flung
across her eyes. She threw herself down
beside her grandfather's bed, sobs shaking
her.</p>

<p>At first it was difficult to understand what
she said, but gradually the words swam out
thickly through her tears, "Oh, I&mdash;I have
done a&mdash;terrible th-thing&mdash;"</p>

<p>A flood of sobs broke through and drowned
the rest. Her grandfather laid a gentle
hand upon her head.</p>

<p>"There, Pilly dear," he said. "Do not cry,
and tell me everything. Look up, child, and
see. Your old grandfather is better tonight,
and soon he will be quite well again. Are
you not glad?"</p>

<p>This made Pilar raise her head. Her
grandfather was speaking to her just as he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
had done before he had been taken so ill.
It was true then that he was much better
tonight.</p>

<p>"Tell me what happened," he repeated.</p>

<p>And Pilar poured out her whole story.</p>

<p>"We have had no money, dear Grandfather,"
she said. "And I have had to sell
everything of value&mdash;everything out of my
mother's chest of souvenirs.</p>

<p>"The castanets were the last to go. Juan
had offered to buy them from me for a great
dancing master, and today I was on my way
to Juan's shop. But I&mdash;I&mdash;stopped in the
Murillo Garden&mdash;and&mdash;and danced&mdash;oh!"</p>

<p>"Go on, Pilly dear," said her grandfather
patiently.</p>

<p>"As I was dancing," she continued, "a
gentleman came up to me and asked to see
the&mdash;the castanets. When I showed them
to him, he said that he would like to buy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
them. He said that he was the dancing master
of whom Juan had spoken.</p>

<p>"Oh, Grandfather, he offered me so much
money for them, and I&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What did you do, Pilly?" asked the old
man.</p>

<p>"I could not sell them, Grandfather!"
sobbed Pilar. "I&mdash;I could not! I ran away
from him. I ran away!"</p>

<h2>A STRANGER ARRIVES</h2>


<p>"Do not cry any more, Pilly," said her
grandfather. "You have done no harm by
keeping the castanets. Perhaps you have
done good. I shall tell you why later on.
But first let us have our dinner."</p>

<p>Pilar tried to smile. She brushed away
her tears. Her grandfather was actually
hungry! Oh, this meant that really and
truly he was getting well!</p>

<p>Pilar started toward the kitchen. She had
planned such a splendid dinner for tonight,
and now they would be obliged to eat beans
and drink milk.</p>

<p>If only she could prepare her grandfather's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
favorite omelet stuffed with
creamed fish, or a bowl of stew, made out
of chick-peas, garlic, potatoes, sausage, peppers,
and cabbage! But&mdash;</p>

<p>What was that white thing lying under
the door? Pilar stooped down and picked
up a letter. It was postmarked "U.S.A."</p>

<p>Now very few of Pilar's friends would
have known what those initials meant. And
even if they had been told, many of them
would have shrieked with laughter and cried,
"Only red Indians live there!"</p>

<p>But Pilar's grandfather had been in
America long ago, and, of course, her mother
had danced there.</p>

<p>The letter came from Antonio Santaella,
and that was Tony&mdash;Tony, who had lived in
Seville as a boy and was now an important
merchant in America. Enclosed in the letter,
Pilar found paper bills&mdash;money&mdash;more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
money than Pilar and her grandfather had
seen in many years!</p>

<p>Tony wrote that he would always remember
Pilar's mother, known as "The Little
Spanish Dancer." He also asked Pilar
whether she, too, would become a dancer
when she grew up.</p>

<p>Pilar's eyes shone.</p>

<p>"Oh, Grandfather!" she cried. "What a
kind man Se&ntilde;or Tony is! How much I love
him! How I wish to be a dancer like my
mother! Shall we have eggs or stew for
dinner?" She had said it all in one breath.
She rushed to open the door on her way to
market, adding, "I shall be right ba&mdash;pf-f-f!"</p>

<p>With a terrible thud, Pilar had bumped
into a tall gentleman who stood at the door.
It was the great dancing master.</p>

<p>"Good evening," he said. "Are you Se&ntilde;orita
Pilar?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>Pilar backed into the room. She looked
like a scared little rabbit. What did he
want? Had he come to take her castanets?</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, you are the Se&ntilde;orita Pilar," continued
the gentleman. He came into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
room, closed the door behind him, and sat
down calmly.</p>

<p>"And this, I believe, is se&ntilde;or, your grandfather.
No?" He smiled at the old man,
who lay quietly in his bed. "You see, I found
out all about you, se&ntilde;orita. After you ran
away from me in the garden, I made up my
mind to follow you, and I did."</p>

<p>Suddenly Pilar's eyes flashed angrily.</p>

<p>"You cannot have the castanets!" she
cried.</p>

<p>She was standing in the center of the
room, and her face was white with fury.
Her small body was drawn up, rigid and
tense.</p>

<p>"I'll never let you have them!" she
screamed. "They're mine! Mine! Mine!"</p>

<p>She stamped her foot and threw back her
head. But the tall gentleman did not seem
in the least disturbed. He just sat there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
looking at her and smiling as if he were
watching a play.</p>

<p>Indeed, one had the impression that he
might begin to clap at any moment. But
he did not.</p>

<p>Instead, he just laughed good-naturedly
and said, "What a little firecracker you are!
And how graceful, too! Now, listen, child."</p>

<p>He had stopped smiling. He leaned forward
and spoke to Pilar in a serious voice.</p>

<p>"Listen to me, Pilar," he said. "I do not
want your castanets if you do not care to
sell them to me. But&mdash;" He hesitated for
a moment while Pilar stared at him, still with
that look of anger and fear in her eyes. "But
I do want something else!"</p>

<p>Pilar's grandfather raised himself upon
his pillow. "What is it that you wish,
Se&ntilde;or?" he asked.</p>

<p>"The Little Spanish Dancer!" replied the
gentleman. "I want Pilar!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>Both Pilar and her grandfather started.
What was this man talking about?</p>

<p>"I want to take Pilar to my school," he
went on, "and teach her. For I believe that
some day she will be a wonderful dancer.
And I should know, for I have taught some
of the best dancers in Spain."</p>

<p>Now Pilar realized who he was. Often she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
had passed the window of his dancing school.
She had watched the fortunate pupils and
listened to the strains of a tango and the
clatter of castanets.</p>

<p>Upon the walls of the school were colored
posters showing scenes of bullfights. Girls
and boys, young and old, stamped their feet
and twirled to fiery music.</p>

<p>It had always made Pilar's heart beat
faster. She had longed to join them. But
lessons were only for wealthy children and&mdash;</p>

<p>"But, se&ntilde;or," said Pilar's grandfather, as
if he had been reading Pilar's mind, "we
have no money to spend on lessons."</p>

<p>"I shall ask no money," replied the dancing
master. "No. Our school will some day
be proud of Se&ntilde;orita Pilar."</p>

<p>He stood up and put out his hand to the
little girl.</p>

<p>"Come tomorrow for your first lesson," he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
said. "My brother will instruct you. My
brother, you know, is the second greatest
dancing master in Spain."</p>

<p>"And who is the first, se&ntilde;or?" asked Pilar's
grandfather.</p>

<p>"Why, I am, of course!" answered the tall
man proudly, and walked out of the room.</p>

<p>When he had left, there was much rejoicing
in the tiny house. Pilar went out and
bought a basket full of good things, and they
had dinner.</p>

<p>After dinner, they sat together, silent and
happy, the old man's wrinkled hand caressing
the child's glossy black hair.</p>

<p>Then all at once, in a low, mysterious voice,
the grandfather began to recite:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>When he had told Pilar about the magic
castanets and the legends with their strange
lessons, she felt a wave of joy sweep through
her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, then, it must have been the magic of
the castanets that brought us all this good
fortune, Grandfather!" she cried.</p>

<p>Her grandfather smiled wisely and shook
his head.</p>

<p>"No, Pilly," he said. "Good fortune always
comes to those who think good
thoughts and who work hard. There is no
